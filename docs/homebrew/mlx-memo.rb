# Homebrew formula for mlx-memo.
#
# Lives in this source tree as a reference copy. To activate it for
# end users, mirror this file to a tap repo named `homebrew-memo`
# under your GitHub user (see `docs/homebrew/README.md`).
# This file tracks the exact source distribution URL published by PyPI.
# On each release, copy the URL and sha256 from the PyPI JSON API before
# mirroring the formula to the public tap.
#
# Users then install with:
#
#     brew tap jagoff/memo
#     brew install mlx-memo
#
# Apple Silicon only — MLX is the load-bearing dep and refuses to
# build on Intel / Linux. The formula enforces this with
# `depends_on arch: :arm64` so brew refuses early.
